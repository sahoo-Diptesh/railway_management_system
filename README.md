# The Railway Management System DBMS will be designed using a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) such as MySQL or Oracle. The system will be developed using a combination of SQL queries, stored procedures, triggers, and views. The final deliverables of the project will include a detailed database schema, a set of SQL queries to create and populate the database, and a user-friendly interface to access the database. The interface will allow users to perform tasks such as booking tickets, checking train schedules, and viewing passenger information. Overall, the Railway Management System DBMS will provide an efficient and reliable way to manage the vast amounts of data associated with railway operations, making it easier for both railway staff and passengers to interact with the system.
